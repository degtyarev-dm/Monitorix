.SH NAME
monitorix.conf \- Configuration file for Monitorix.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Monitorix is a free, open source, lightweight system monitoring tool designed to monitor as many services and system resources as possible. It has been created to be used on production Linux/UNIX servers, but due to its simplicity and small size may also be used to monitor embedded devices as well.
.P
It consists mainly of two programs: a collector, called \fBmonitorix\fP, which is a Perl daemon that is started automatically like any other system service, and a CGI script called \fBmonitorix.cgi\fP. Since 3.0 version Monitorix includes its own HTTP server built in, so you don't need to install any web server to use it.
.P
Every time \fBmonitorix\fP is started it reads the configuration file from the path specified in the command line (using the \fB-c\fP option), and once checked, it creates the \fIindex.html\fP file that will act as the Monitorix main page.
.P
It also creates a file called \fI<base_dir>/cgi/monitorix.conf.path\fP that includes the absolute path of the configuration file. This file will be read by \fBmonitorix.cgi\fP to determine the exact location of the configuration file.
.SH CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
Blank lines are ignored, and whitespace before and after a token or value is ignored as well as tabulators, although a value can contain whitespace within. Lines which begin with a # are considered comments and ignored.
.P
If you want to comment out a large block you can use C-style comments. A /* signals the begin of a comment block and the */ signals the end of the comment block.
.P
If an option has multiple values their must be separated by comma.
.P
.BI title
.RS
A description of the server; where it is located, the Company name, etc.
.P
Default value: \fIPlace a Title Here\fP
.RE
.P

This section enables or disables the alert capabilities for this graph. Only the alert for the average CPU load is currently implemented. It works as follows:
.P
The CPU load average uses the third value (the one that represents the last 15 minutes of the load average), and if it reaches the \fBloadavg_threshold\fP value for the interval of time defined in \fBloadavg_timeintvl\fP, Monitorix will execute the external alert script defined in \fBloadavg_script\fP.

.RE
.P
Some of the values shown in the graphs are the result of a calculation of two values from either \fISHOW [GLOBAL] STATUS\fP or \fISHOW VARIABLES\fP. The following is an explanation of them:
.P
\fBThread Cache Hit Rate\fP
.br
\fB(1 - (Threads_created / Connections)) * 100\fP
.br
When an application connects to a MySQL database, the database has to create a thread to manage the connection and the queries that will be sent in that connection. The database instructs the kernel to create a new thread, and the kernel allocates resources and creates the thread, then returns it to the MySQL service. When the connection is terminated by the application, MySQL tells the kernel to destroy the thread and free the resources. This create/destroy mechanism causes considerable overhead if the MySQL server has many new connections per second.
.br
If MySQL doesn't destroy the thread when the connection is terminated, but reuses it and assigns it to the next connection then this will decrease the kernel overhead. This is why a high \fBThread Cache Hit Rate\fP improves MySQL performance and decreases the system's CPU usage.
.br
Setting the parameter \fIthread_cache_size\fP in the \fImy.cnf\fP file accordingly will help to correctly balance between having a great thread cache and keeping MySQL memory consumption reasonable.
.br
Higher is better.
.P
\fBQuery Cache Hit Rate\fP
.br
\fBQcache_hits / (Qcache_hits + Com_select) * 100\fP
.br
Higher should be considered better.
.br
A query cache size increase is recommended if the query cache usage is very close to 100% and the query cache hit rate is far from 100%. But sometimes a size increase will not lead to a better hit rate: this means that the increase was not needed and that the application do not run enough cacheable SELECT queries.
.br
This value should grow proportionally with the number of executed queries as long as the query cache is performing well. Please also have a look at the \fBQuery cache usage\fP percentage to know if your query_cache configuration is appropriate.
.P
For more information please refer to http://www.databasejournal.com/features/mysql/article.php/3808841/Optimizing-the-MySQL-Query-Cache.htm
.P
\fBQuery Cache Usage\fP
.br
\fB(1 - (Qcache_free_memory / query_cache_size)) * 100\fP
.br
This value should be reasonably far from 100%, otherwise consider incrementing the \fIquery_cache_size\fP parameter in \fImy.cnf\fP.
.P
\fBConnections Usage\fP
.br
\fB(Max_used_connections / max_connections) * 100\fP
.br
This value should be reasonably far from 100%, otherwise consider incrementing the \fImax_connections\fP parameter in \fImy.cnf\fP.
.P
\fBKey Buffer Usage\fP
.br
\fB(Key_blocks_used / (Key_blocks_used + Key_blocks_unused)) * 100\fP
.br
This value should be reasonably far from 100%, otherwise consider incrementing the \fIkey_buffer_size\fP parameter in \fImy.cnf\fP.
.P
\fBInnoDB Buffer Pool Usage\fP
.br
\fB(1 - (Innodb_buffer_pool_pages_free / Innodb_buffer_pool_pages_total)) * 100\fP
.br
This value should be reasonably far from 100%, otherwise consider incrementing the \fIinnodb_buffer_pool_size\fP parameter in \fImy.cnf\fP.
.P
\fBTemp. Tables To Disk\fP
.br
\fB(Created_temp_disk_tables / Created_temp_disk_tables + Created_temp_tables)) * 100\fP
.br
During operation, MySQL has to create some temporary tables (that can be explicit, so created by the web application, or implicit, so for example MySQL has to create one when he runs some "SELECT DISTINCT", "UNION" or "VIEW" queries). MySQL will prefer to save this tmp tables to memory, for a fast access. But if 'tmp_table_size' gets saturated, he has to write them on the disk instead, making the access slower.
.br
Therefore this value helps to know how many tmp tables go to the disk instead than to the memory. Keep in mind that some large queries, involving TEXT and BLOB columns, are directly written to the disk instead than to the memory, because they would be too big. So you probably will want to avoid having a high % of tmp tables written to the disk, but you will never reach 0% on a big site, and this is fine.
.br
Lower is better ... but 0% is not reachable and you should not try to reach it, usually.
