.SH NAME
monitorix - a lightweight system monitoring tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmonitorix\fR \fB-c\fR configfile [\fB-p\fR pidfile] [\fB-d\fR none | graph[,graph] | all] [\fB-v\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This Perl daemon starts the main Monitorix process, which gathers statistics about the system it is running on and stores this information in a set of RRD files.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-c\fR \fIconfigfile\fR
The default location of the configuration file varies depending on the operating system:
.P
.RS
Linux:        \fI/etc/monitorix.conf\fP
.br
FreeBSD:      \fI/usr/local/etc/monitorix.conf\fP
.P
.RE
.TP
\fB\-p\fR \fIpidfile\fR
Stores the daemon's process ID into the specified file.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR none | graph[,graph] | all
Logs more information about what \fBmonitorix\fP is doing internally. The keys reflect if the data collected must be displayed on each case. If \fBall\fP is defined, the data collected of all enabled graphs will be shown. If \fBnone\fP is defined no data collected will be shown. Finally it is also possible to define a comma-separated list of graph names from which show their data collected.
.br
For a reference of all graph names check the option \fBgraph_name\fP in the \fImonitorix.conf\fP configuration file.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
Displays version information.
.SH SIGNALS
On receipt of a SIGHUP, \fBmonitorix\fP will close and reopen its log file. This is useful in scripts which rotate and age log files.
.P
Note that the configuration file is not re-read.
.SH FILES
The following set of the files are created on every startup:
.TP 8
\fB<base_dir>/cgi/monitorix.conf.path\fP
Stores the path of \fIconfigfile\fP.
.TP 8
\fB<base_dir>/cgi/monitorix.hplog\fP
